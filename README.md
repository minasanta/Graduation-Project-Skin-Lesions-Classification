# Graduation-Project-Skin-Lesions-Classification

### Abstract
***
Skin lesions, such as moles and melanomas, present significant challenges in diagnosis.

This project focuses on developing a system using deep learning techniques to classify skin lesions from dermoscopic images.

main dataset, HAM10000 utilized for training and evaluating machine learning models.

The system leverages TensorFlow for model development and Flask for creating an API to facilitate seamless integration with a Flutter-based mobile application.

Key components include image preprocessing techniques like resizing and data augmentation to enhance model accuracy.

The InceptionResNet model, trained on resized images, achieves a notable 96.13% accuracy in lesion classification. The project also emphasizes the use of Colab for GPU-accelerated computations and Git for version control.

Future enhancements aim to further refine the model's accuracy, integrate real-time lesion detection capabilities, and ensure compliance with medical standards. By providing a user-friendly interface and reliable diagnostic capabilities, this system aims to assist healthcare professionals in timely and accurate skin lesion diagnosis, ultimately improving patient care outcomes.
